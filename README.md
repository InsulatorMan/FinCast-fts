FinCast is a **decoder-only transformer** trained on over **20B financial time points** across diverse domains and temporal resolutions.  
Technical Highlights:
- **PQ-Loss**: Joint point + probabilistic forecasting.
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**: Specialization across domains.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Features
- Foundation model for **financial time-series forecasting**, flexible input and output length.
- Strong performance in **zero-shot**, **supervised**, and **few-shot** settings.
- Modular architecture with **MoE** and **quantile-aware loss**.
- Scalable to **billions of parameters** with efficient inference.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

- The model weight can be found on ðŸ¤— https://huggingface.co/Vincent05R/FinCast
- The model code can be found on https://github.com/vincent05r/FinCast-fts
- The corresponding datasets to reproduce the results can be found on https://huggingface.co/datasets/Vincent05R/FinCast-Paper-test

Run the env_setup.sh first then run the dep_install.sh. We use conda as the venv management.

## ðŸ“Š Experiments

- run the corresponding scripts in the scripts directory to reproduce the results in the paper. The result summary can be generate using the result summary notebook in the notebook directory.



## âš¡ Future Updates

- PEFT finetune(LORA/DORA) is done, just need to do some testing
- Package together for easy inference
- Covariate Inference(currently implemented the same code as timesfm)
